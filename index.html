          <h2>Organization:</h2>
          <p>Boxing is well known as one of the best full body workouts 
            you can get. The workout is for everybody the same, from full 
            time athletes or absolute beginners. The difference is only the 
            intensity with which someone does the drill. We teach real boxing! 
            Not the fitness version. But sparring with contact is only available 
            outside regular workouts and only for advanced boxers. Through this 
            approach you will learn how to defend yourself simple and effectively, 
            but won´t get hurt in training sessions. The concept was proven and 
            has long been established in the world’s biggest boxing gym: The 
            Pugilist Boxing Gym in Germany. We also have the founder of Pugilist 
            and Aiba 3 star coach Bardia Gharib as technical advisor.</p>

              <h2>Problem:</h2>
              While our team was over looking there curent website, we noticed 
              it was not up to date with photos, team members.  
            </P>
            <p>
              <h2>Solution:</h2>
              After speacking with the Soul Fighters Club President we came to 
              an agreement that we would make the site slightly more interactive 
              and more informal with class location and time, and more personal with 
              the team members when individuals would look at there site.
